# project-euler
Project Euler practice repo, language-agnostic. Each problem folder includes my hand-written solutions plus alternative solutions from different LLMs (with prompts, models, tests, and complexity notes). Reusable test harnesses, benchmarks, and CI help verify correctness across Python, JS/TS, Rust, Go, and more.
